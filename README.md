# My Personal Websites

The goal is to create a platform where I can learn to write. Along the way I also want to learn on the engineering stuff such as:
- Basic web programming (HTML, CSS, JS: All vanilla)
- Integrating with Public API
- FastAPI (Py)
- Asynchronous Programming (Py)
- Jinja (Py)
- Creating CI (not implemented)/CD with GitHub Actions

Expected things that I want to create is things like:
- Deploying ML to production
- integration with GCP 
But let's see whether that possible or not

# Stack
- Mostly Python: FastAPI, Jinja (is it counted?), 
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS 
- GitHub Actions
- Also [Deta](https://deta.sh) (please check this supercool platform to deploy fastAPI app)
